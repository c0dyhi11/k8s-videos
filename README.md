# Kubernetes Videos
This repo houses code snipets and example files to accompany YouTube videos.

This repository is [Experimental](https://github.com/packethost/standards/blob/master/experimental-statement.md) meaning that it's based on untested ideas or techniques and not yet established or finalized or involves a radically new and innovative style! This means that support is best effort (at best!) and we strongly encourage you to NOT use this in production.
